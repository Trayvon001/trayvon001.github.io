In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills, building robots, and developing software. Seeing the robots and programs I design work smoothly always gives me a great sense of accomplishment. Below are two of the robots and software I've built. 

## A Self-balancing Two-wheeled Robot
I built this robot in collaboration with a classmate from scratch. This involved designing the mechanical structure, drawing the circuit board, soldering components, assembling the robot, and writing the autonomous control program.

## A Paper Feeding Software Powered by LLMs ( Programming Language: Swift )

This is a software I developed to automatically recommend papers that interest me. It fetches new papers from arXiv on a daily basis, uses a large language model to analyze and tag them, and then sends me those that match my research interests. This software is written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).
