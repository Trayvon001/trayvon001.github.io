Hi, I am Chengwen Qi (ÈΩêÊâøÊñá), a master student at Beihang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yuanjun Laili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_AN5DgQAAAAJ), majoring in Electronics and Information. I also had the honor to work with [Dr. Bowen Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RLWXNf8AAAAJ) and [Dr. Ren Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=7RlHXTAAAAAJ) at Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory during my master‚Äôs study. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Robotics Engineering from Beihang University in 2022. 

My primary research interests include **LLM Reasoning** and **Neuro-Symbolic AI**. I am also interested in **improving the reliability of LLMs** and **advancing their reasoning capabilities in specialized fields**, such as in science and industry. 

I am open to research collaborations! If you share similar research interests with me and are looking for research collaborations, feel free to email me!

Miscellaneous
======
I'm passionate about sports, including hiking ü•æ, swimming üèä, running üèÉ ( I can run 5 kilometers in 19 minutes üòé), cycling üö¥, and skiing üéø. These activities help me stay energetic and refresh my mind. I enjoy the scenery in hiking and cycling ‚Äî you never know what wonders you'll encounter.

In my free time, I also love building my own [robots](/misc/) and developing my own [software](/misc/). Seeing the robots and software I designed work smoothly always gives me a great sense of accomplishment.

I speak three languages: [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese) ( native ), [Huizhou Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huizhou_Chinese) ( native ), [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) ( IELTS: 8.0 ).
